# Tractivity
Web application to help users track their fitness progress and set fitness goals. 

## How it works

### Dashboard
Every user has a personalized dashboard displaying a bar graph of their weekly workouts based on the type of activity completed (default set to 'Walk'). Users can select any activity from a dropdown to reveal the bar graph of their workouts for that activity over the past week. They can also change the date from a date picker to reveal all their workouts for the selected activity during the week ending with the selected date.  
The dashboard also displays a dismissable reminder for the next activity that the user is scheduled to complete. 

### Logging Past Activities
Users can log their past activities along with the date, type of activity, and number of units of that activity completed. These will be stored in a database of past entries and displayed in a table under the 'Past Activities' tab. Each activity will be assigned a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard), keeping in mind that this app is intended for beginners just starting on their fitness journeys. Users can filter these entries by date and difficulty level. 

### Logging Future Goals
Users can log activities that they intend to complete on later dates. These will be stored in a database of future entries and displayed in list format under the 'Future Goals' tab. Users will receive a reminder on their dashboard for the closest upcoming activity they have scheduled.

## Future plans for this project

### Badges Feature
The dashboard will display badges for weekly or monthly achievements, including:
- Starter Spirit: This badge will be awarded to those users who have completed at least one week of continuous workouts (any activity) without a break.
- Go Getter: This badge will be awarded to those users who have completed at least 10 days of 'medium' level workouts.
- Fitness Pro: This badge will be awarded to those users who have completed at least 10 days of 'hard' level workouts.
- Motivation Master: This badge will be awarded to those users who have completed at least 30 days of continuous workouts (any activity) without a break.
- Other badges will be awarded based on activity (example, walking 10 continuous days, biking for 10 continuous days, etc.).

### Nutrition Tracker
This will be another tab where users can log their daily meals. They will then be shown on what levels of the food pyramid they have fulfilled, and what levels they still need nutrients in.
